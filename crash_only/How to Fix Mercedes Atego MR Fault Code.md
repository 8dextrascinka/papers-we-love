# How to Fix Mercedes Atego MR Fault Code
 
Mercedes Atego is a series of light-duty trucks produced by Mercedes-Benz since 1998. The Atego is equipped with an engine management system (MR) control unit that monitors and controls various engine functions. The MR control unit can detect and store fault codes if there are any problems with the engine or its components.

One of the common fault codes that may appear on the Atego is the MR fault code, which indicates a problem with the CAN (Controller Area Network) communication between the MR control unit and other control units, such as the FR (Drive Control) control unit. The CAN bus is a network of wires that allows different electronic devices to communicate with each other.
 
The MR fault code can have different numbers and meanings depending on the specific problem. For example, MR 0101 means that the CAN-L connection to FR is faulty, MR 0102 means that the data from the FR control unit is erroneous, and so on. You can find a list of MR fault codes and their meanings on this website[^1^].
 
To fix the MR fault code, you need to diagnose the cause of the problem using a diagnostic tool that can read and clear the fault codes. You also need to check the wiring and connectors of the CAN bus for any damage, corrosion, or loose connections. If there is any damage or corrosion, you need to repair or replace the affected parts. If there are any loose connections, you need to tighten them securely.
 
If the wiring and connectors are in good condition, you need to check the voltage and resistance of the CAN bus using a multimeter. The voltage should be between 2.5 and 3 volts, and the resistance should be between 60 and 70 ohms. If the voltage or resistance is out of range, you need to find and fix the source of the problem.
 
If you cannot find any problem with the CAN bus, you need to check the MR control unit and the FR control unit for any faults or damage. You may need to replace one or both of them if they are faulty or damaged.
 
After fixing the problem, you need to clear the fault codes using a diagnostic tool and test drive the vehicle to see if the MR fault code reappears. If it does not reappear, you have successfully fixed it. If it does reappear, you need to repeat the diagnostic and repair process until you find and fix the root cause of the problem.

Here are some tips to prevent the MR fault code from occurring again:
 
- Keep the CAN bus wiring and connectors clean and dry. Avoid exposing them to moisture, dirt, or chemicals.
- Do not modify or splice the CAN bus wiring. Follow the manufacturer's specifications and guidelines when installing or repairing any electronic devices connected to the CAN bus.
- Use only genuine and compatible parts when replacing the MR control unit, the FR control unit, or any other components related to the engine management system.
- Perform regular maintenance and service on your Mercedes Atego according to the recommended schedule. Check the engine oil level, coolant level, fuel filter, air filter, and other engine parts for any signs of wear or damage.
- Drive your Mercedes Atego carefully and avoid overloading, overheating, or abusing the engine. Follow the proper driving procedures and safety precautions.

By following these tips, you can extend the life of your Mercedes Atego and avoid the MR fault code and other engine problems.
